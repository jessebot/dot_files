# Dot Files for `onboardme`

These are the sensible defaults for [`onboardme`](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme), but also the personal dot files of @cloudymax and @jessebot. The directories/files are installed to your home directory and follow the [XDG Base Directory Spec] as closely as possible.

  We also provide a couple of basic presets in this dir:

    <summary><code>nvim</code></summary>

  <blockquote>

  [neovim] is a hyperextensible Vim-based text editor, which is in some ways a sucessor to [vim]. It's a lot faster, for one, and there's more support for more languages, which means more plugins. Uses [lazy.nvim] to manage neovim plugins.

  Each file explained below:

  ### [`init.lua`](.config/nvim/init.lua)
  The main global configuration changes are:
  - turning off mouse scrolling (might re-enable this ü§î)
  - enabling line numbers
  - adding a cursorline
  - <kbd>enter</kbd> folds the current code block
  - <kbd>space</kbd> is our leader key (a custom modifier key for neovim)
  - setting column 80 to be a different color for tidy code
  - searches are case insensitive
  - enabling gui colors so you aren't limited to like 16 colors
  - uses the [spacechalk.nvim] colorscheme
  - sources all the files in [`~/.config/nvim/lua`](.config/nvim/lua),
    including all our [plugin configs](.config/nvim/lua/user/lazy.lua).
  - adds a nice little terminal called [toggleterm.nvim] in [`toggleterm.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/toggleterm.lua)


  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/lazy.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/lazy.lua)
  This is the configuration for [`lazy.nvim`], our plugin manager for neovim. It
  installs lazy, and then all of our plugins.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/dashboard.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/dashboard.lua)
  config for a starting screen [dashboard] for neovim. You should just check out the file to see what's being done. It's cute ascii art, and utilizes [telescope] to open your recent files or search your files. 

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/folding.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/folding.lua)
  config file to enable folding, which is just vim speak for collapsing
  blocks of code. Sets some defaults.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/nvim-tree.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/nvim-tree.lua)
  config file for [nvim-tree], a neovim file explorer written in lua, with icons.

  Opens on opening of any file, and auto-adjusts its window size.

  ### [`~/.config/nvim/lua/user/tree-sitter.lua`](.config/nvim/lua/user/tree-sitter.lua)
  config file for the nvim [tree-sitter] plugin, which helps with syntax highlighting of various languages.

  currently installing syntax for: "lua", "yaml", "bash", "hcl"

  - `MAIL_USER` - normally youruser@protonmail.com for protonmail
  - `MAIL_PASS` - normally generated from the protonmail bridge app
  - `MAIL_PORT` - typically 1143 for protonmail

  Currently we import ALL folders except the "All Mail" folder, which is just
  all the mail from all the other folders (including inbox, sent, trash, etc)

  - [`~/.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf`](.config/spotifyd/spotifyd.conf)

  [spotifyd] is a spotify daemon used in combination with [spotify-tui] or
  other alternative spotify frontends.

  Current settings are for Linux only. I will add a macOS file and appropriate
  aliases and docs soon :)

  For Linux, this still requires a premium account, but then you can follow
  the potify-tui api connection instructions].


  (You also need to change your cache in spotifyd.conf to be your username)

  After that, just make sure you have your spotify credentials in bitwarden,
  and that you are logged into bitwarden via the [bw] cli. DON'T FORGET TO
  EXPORT YOUR SESSION ID! Then you HAVE TO RESTART SPOTIFYD!

  ```bash
  brew services restart spotifyd
  ```

  **Linux Note:** If you did a `brew install spotifyd`, then you might have to
  `brew edit spotifyd`, and then fix the hardcoded macOS backend to be `alsa`.
  Then you need to do a `brew reinstall --build-from-source spotifyd`.

  After that, you can use commands such as `spt` (spotify-tui) to launch a lightweight terminal frontend. You can follow spotify-tui's instructions above, but the most important part is going to be creating your own little spotify app which you can do after logging into the [developer spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

Please feel free to fork this repo and make it your own.
You can still use `onboardme`, but you'll want to pass in _your_ git URL and branch. Example:

```bash
# this uses your personal git URL and makes sure to always pull from main
# if you want to overwrite your existing dot files, you can also add --overwrite to this command
onboardme --git_url https://github.com/your_username/dot_files --git_branch main
```
