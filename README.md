Get¬†your¬†daily¬†driver¬†just¬†the¬†way¬†you¬†like¬†it,¬†from¬†dot¬†files installation,¬†to¬†opensource¬†package¬†installation, to other little features you didn't know you needed,¬†`onboardme` intends to save you¬†time¬†with¬†initializing¬†and¬†upgrading¬†your¬†environment.

## Features

#### Dot files
- Manage your [dot files] using a git repo (or use [our default dot files] üòÉ)

#### Package management
- Install and upgrade libraries and apps
  - use several package managers across Linux and macOS (you can even add your own!)
  - group together packages for different kinds of setups, e.g. gaming, devops, gui

#### Vim/NeoVim Plugin Management
- Keep your [vim-plug] or [packer] plugins installed and up to date in both vim and neovim.

#### Easy `yaml` config files
- [config files](https://github.com/jessebot/onboardme#configuration) in your `$HOME/.config/onboardme/` directory
  - we also support the [XDG Base Directory Spec] and will use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/onboardme/` if you have `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` configured

#### Other useful (but optional) configurations
- Enable touchID for sudo on macOS
- Add your user to the docker group
- Install nerdfonts (defaults to Hack and Mononoki)
- Set capslock to control

## Quick Start

### Installation
The quickest way to get started on a fresh macOS or distrubtion of Debian (including Ubuntu) is:

```bash
# this will download setup.sh to your current directory and run it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessebot/onboardme/main/setup.sh)"

# this will display the help text for the onboardme cli
onboardme --help
```

If you've already got brew and Python3.11 on your machine, you can just do `pip` install onboardme.

You can read more in depth at the [Getting Started Docs] üíô! There's also more [docs] on basically every program that onboardme touches.

### Upgrades
If you're on python 3.11, you should be able to do:

```bash
pip3.11 install --upgrade onboardme
```

### Configuration
onboardme has lots of CLI options, but you can also use config files. You have to create these files for the time being.

Config files are in `~/.config/onboardme/` (will use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, if defined). Examples below:

<details>
<summary><code>config.yaml</code></summary>


```yaml
log:
  # Full path to a file you'd like to log to. Creates file if it doesn't exist
  file: ""
  # what level of logs to output (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
  level: "INFO"

# steps refer to a specific function in the list of functions we run
steps:
  # these are mac specific steps
  Darwin:
    - dot_files
    - packages
    - font_setup
    - vim_setup
    - neovim_setup
    - sudo_setup
  # these are linux specific steps
  Linux:
    - dot_files
    - packages
    - font_setup
    - vim_setup
    - neovim_setup
    - group_setup

dot_files:
  # personal git repo URL for your dot files, defaults to jessebot/dot_files
  git_url: "https://github.com/jessebot/dot_files.git"
  # the branch to use for the git repo above, defaults to main
  git_branch: "main"
  # !CAREFUL: runs a `git reset --hard`, which will overwite/delete local files in ~ that
  # conflict with the above defined git repo url and branch. You should run
  # `onboardme -s dot_files` to get the files that would be overwritten
  overwrite: false

# basic package config
package:
  # Remove any of the below pkg managers to only run the remaining pkg managers
  managers:
    # these are macOS specific steps
    Darwin:
      - brew
      - pip3.11
    # these are linux specific steps
    Linux:
      - brew
      - pip3.11
      - apt
      - snap
      - flatpak
  # list of extra existing packages groups to install
  groups:
    - default
    # uncomment these to add them as default installed package groups
    # - gui
    # - gaming
    # - devops
```
