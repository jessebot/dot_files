  # this is where the actual git config for your dot files lives
  # it can't live in ~/.git because that will affect _everything_ under ~/
  git_config_dir: "/home/friend/.config/dot_files"
  # !!CAREFUL: runs a `git reset --hard`, which will overwite/delete files in 
  # $HOME that conflict with the above defined git repo url and branch.
  # You should run the following to get the files that would be overwritten:
  # onboardme -s dot_files
  # if set to true, then using onboardme -O will toggle it back to false
  overwrite: true
